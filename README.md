# Cardiovascular-Diseases
This project aims to build prediction models for assessing the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients and to analyze factors that can predict the presence of cardiovascular disease. 
The goal is to derive insights from an existing dataset of 70,000 patient records to identify which features may have the most significant influence on cardiovascular disease and identify potential avenues for further research. 
Machine learning algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests, were used to build predictive models of CVD.
